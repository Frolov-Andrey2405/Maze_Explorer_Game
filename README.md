# Maze_Explorer_Game
 In this two-dimensional maze game, the player observes from above a maze file you have created in a text editor, such as your IDE, where you create your .py files. Using the WASD keys, the player moves the @ symbol up, left, down, and right, heading toward the exit indicated by the X symbol.
